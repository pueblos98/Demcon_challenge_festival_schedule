This code was made for a challenge I found on LinkedIN posted by Demcon. The challenge description can be found in the end of this #README.

Enter a schedule in the input.csv file which can be found in the input folder.
The input has to be "," seperated and has to contain three columns where the first column is the name of the show/band performing, second column is an integer of when the performance starts, and the third column is an integer of when it ends.
No headers. Forexample:
show_1,1,3
show_2,1,4
show_3,1,3
show_4,1,2
show_5,1,6
show_6,3,8
show_7,4,7
show_8,5,8
show_9,6,10

Ones the input is entered, head over to main.py and run the code. Ones completed the schedule can be found in the output folder.
There are three files to be found in the output folder.
info.txt gives some extra details of the schedule or the errors if there were any.
schema_verticaal gives the schedule with the stages as columns and times as a value in the rows.
schema_horizontaal gives the schedule, but with the times as columns and stages as a value in the rows.




Challenge details:
Demcon has decided to expand its activities, and to organize a musical festival. After being an expert in mechatronic systems engineering, the move to the entertainment business seems a rather logical choice.

For the festival 30 acts are hired, such as the Demcon band and other popular acts. Unfortunately, each band has a very tight schedule, and is only able to play at a fixed timeslot. This makes the planning difficult, and the festival organizer needs to know how many stages to prepare for the event.

Your job is to help the festival organization. You are given a list of shows, each with a start and end time. The start and end times are provided as an offset from the start of the festival since the festival goes on non-stop. For example, the first three shows are given like this:

show_1 36 39
show_2 30 33
show_3 29 36

show_1 is scheduled from 36 hours after festival start and will play for 4 long hours up to (and including) hour 39 after festival start.

It can be seen that show_1 and show_3 overlap, since they both play at hour 36. Also show_2 and show_3 overlap, so they cannot share a stage.

Your task is to create a planning program which takes the list of shows, and their start and end times, and creates a planning.

Good luck!
SPECIFICS & RULES

    Please write your solution in Python/C++/Matlab.
    Please add information (in the README) on how to execute the code.
    Your solution should be able to output a schedule explaining where and when each show will be. How you do this, is up to you. Just know that we do like a good-looking and well-constructed output ;)
    Weâ€™ve included an example list below for you to get started, but your code should be able to handle any schedule. Additionally, feel free to use another input format or file type, as long as you clearly explain what the input should look like.
    We will evaluate your solutions based on inventiveness, efficiency, and good coding practices.
